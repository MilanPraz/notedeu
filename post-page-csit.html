    <h2 class="sub-heading">Looking For Best CSIT College?</h2>
    <p class="post-text">In Nepal, there are only 15 government institutions out of a total of 45 private colleges. To begin with, passing the IOST entrance exam is a requirement for enrollment in these CSIT Colleges. </p>
    <p class="post-text">Before enrolling in private colleges, the primary considerations are the fee structure and location. We have chosen the top 10 CSIT schools in the Kathmandu Valley. Check out the Top BSc CSIT Colleges in Kathmandu below.</p>
    <!--LIst of college starts-->
    <h2 class="sub-heading">1.Patan Multiple Campus(PMC)</h2>
    <img src="img/Patan-Multiple-Campus-is-one-of-the-best-college-for-CSIT-in-Nepal.jpg" class="header-img">
    <p class="post-text">The majority of students favor attending Patan Multiple Campus. The cutoff point for Patan Multiple Campus is higher than ASCOL this year, though. To be admitted to this college, you must take the entrance exam well-prepared and earn a score of at least 70 out of 100 to have your name placed on the second list. Additionally, it provides 148 seats in total for the CSIT program.</p>
    <p class="post-text">In Patan Dhoka, Lalitpur, is where you can find Patan Multiple Campus. On the 17th Bhadra of 2011BS, it was initially founded under the name "Patan Inter College." On Bhadra 31, 2021 BS, Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah officially opened it.</p>


    <h2 class="sub-heading">2.Amrit Science College(ASCOL)</h2>
    <img src="img/Amrit-Science-Campus.jpg" class="header-img">

    <p class="post-text">One of the most well-known CSIT colleges in Nepal is Amrit Science Campus, or ASCOL for short. The primary cause of this is the government college's low tuition rates. Regarding the cost, a four-year course will cost you roughly 3 lakhs. It is also situated in Lainchaur, Kathmandu.</p>
    <p class="post-text">Since the majority of the best students opt to attend ASCOL, there is fierce rivalry to get into this college. If we use the 2022 intake as a benchmark, the entrance threshold for ASCOL is somewhere around 65. However, if you have approximately 65 marks, you must wait until the third or fourth merit list.</p>


    <h2 class="sub-heading">3.St.Xavier College</h2>
    <img src="img/St.-Xavier-College.jpg" class="header-img">
    <p class="post-text">St. Xavier's College, a higher education facility in Maitighar, Kathmandu, was founded in 1988 A.D. and is run by the Nepal Jesuit Society. By producing highly competent human resources, the college has provided high-quality education and helped the country's development. St. Xavier's College now offers 13 distinct programs. It offers Ten Plus Two (10+2) Science curriculum through connection with National Examination Board and A-level Non-Science and Science under Cambridge Assessment International Education (NEB)</p>
    <p class="post-text">Almost all students should try this college if they are unable to get into a government institution. However, due to the intense competition, you must score lower than 1000 on the IOST entrance exam to get admitted to St. Xavier College.</p>



    
    <h2 class="sub-heading">4.Bhaktapur Multiple Campus</h2>
    <img src="img/bmc.jpg" class="header-img">
    <p class="post-text">Another public college is Bhaktapur Multiple Campus. It implies that the cost of a BSc in CSIT at this campus is at least double that of a private institution. Although it is not as well-known as the other two government colleges mentioned above, its affordability is attracting students' interest.</p>
    <p class="post-text">The Master of Business Studies (MBS), Bachelor of Business Studies (BBS), Bachelor of Arts (BA), B.Sc. CSIT, Master of Arts (MA) in Nepali, and MA in Rural Development programs are all available at this campus, which is situated at Doodhpati-17 in Bhaktapur.</p>

    
    <h2 class="sub-heading">5.Madan Bhandari Memorial College</h2>
    <img src="img/Madan-Bhandari-Memorial-College.jpg" class="header-img">
    <p class="post-text">In a similar vein, Madan Bhandari Memorial College is ranked sixth among the top BSc CSIT schools in Kathmandu by us. This college is situated in the prestigious Kathmandu valley neighborhood of New Baneshwor. Since it is a community institution that is not for business, most students can attend it for a cheap price.

    </p>
    <p class="post-text">Although Madan Bhandari Memorial College has less competition than St. Xavier College, you still need to get about 1200 on the entrance exam to be listed on the first merit list.</p>

    
    <h2 class="sub-heading">6.College of Applied Business</h2>
    <img src="img/College-Of-Applied-Business.jpg" class="header-img">
    <p class="post-text">The College of Applied Business, or CAB, is a college in Kathmandu's Gangahity, Chabahil district. It is one of Kathmandu's top BSc. CSIT colleges. Students have ranked this college among their top choices for where to study for the BSc. CSIT course. Its low charge structure is one of the primary causes of this. This degree may be finished in just under 8 lakhs.</p>
    <p class="post-text">In light of this, admission to this college is not very difficult. You can use this as a benchmark because this year's cutoff point for this college was roughly 50. You must score more than 55 to be safe.</p>

    
    <h2 class="sub-heading">7.Deerwalk Institute of Technology</h2>
    <img src="img/Deerwalk-Institute-of-Technology.jpg" class="header-img">
    <p class="post-text">The most expensive university on this list of the top BSc CSIT Universities in Nepal is Deerwalk Institute of Technology. The total cost to complete the BSc. CSIT program at this college is about 16 lakh rupees. However, they also put on a variety of activities and events to help students enhance their skills in addition to having a premium tuition structure.</p>
    <p class="post-text">The Deerwalk Institute of Technology doesn't have a particularly competitive admissions process like other private colleges. The college abruptly implemented a first-come, first-served admissions policy last year. Aspirants who have cleared the entrance exam can therefore simply enroll in this college.</p>

    
    <h2 class="sub-heading">8.New Summit College</h2>
    <img src="img/nsc.jpg" class="header-img">
    <p class="post-text">New Summit is the next organization on our ranking of the best BSc CSIT schools in Nepal. Additionally, Baneshwor, Kathmandu, and Santinagar have it. In comparison to the previous institution, this one is slightly better run and more affordable.

    </p>
    <p class="post-text">Using the 2022 intake as a benchmark, applicants who passed the IOST entrance exam may be admitted to this college. Do not speed through the college selection process like I did. You can wait till the third merit list since the majority of students at many colleges fill out priority forms.

    </p>

    
    <h2 class="sub-heading">9. Sagarmatha College of Science and Technology
    </h2>
    <img src="img/Sagarmatha-College-is-one-of-the-best-college-for-BSc-CSIT-in-Nepal-1024x768.jpg" class="header-img">
    <p class="post-text">Sagarmatha College of Science and Technology is the greatest private college option if you are from Lalitpur. However, if you are not, you might think about enrolling in this college because it offers exceptional results and high-quality education. The cost structure is the only aspect of this college that I didn't enjoy. This four-year course costs more than ten lakhs, which is a little more than other colleges on this list.

    </p>
    <p class="post-text">Similar to the other colleges described above, admittance to this one is not very difficult. You simply need to pass the entrance exam given by TU IOST to enroll in this college.

    </p>


    <h2 class="sub-heading">10. Prime College
    </h2>
    <img src="img/Prime-College.jpg" class="header-img">
    <p class="post-text">Prime College is the final institution on our list of the top BSc CSIT schools in Nepal. It is also a private college situated in Kathmandu's Nayabazar district. If your IOST exam score was greater than 50, you will have no trouble getting into this college.

    </p>
    <p class="post-text">These cutoff scores are based on 2078 merit lists from various colleges. As its 4-year semester cost for CSIT is somewhere around NPR 8 Lakhs, Prime College is regarded as one of the more economical private universities for the program.
